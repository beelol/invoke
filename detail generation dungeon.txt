If we want to give walls different features based on where they are facing or where they are placed,
we can perform checks on what blocks are next to them. For example if a corner's top right diagonal is a tile
as well as its right and top, then it is a right corner. Then we can give it the proper wooden frame for example.
or, if a wall is between two other walls, we could give it a torch. etc.
